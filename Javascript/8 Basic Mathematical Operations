Challenge:
Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Solution:
function basicOp(operation, value1, value2)
{
  var x;
  if (operation === "+") {
    x = value1 + value2;
  } else if (operation === "-") {
    x = value1 - value2;
  } else if (operation === "*") {
    x = value1 * value2;
    } else if (operation === "/") {
    x = value1 / value2;
    }
    return x;
}

NOTE: After finishing this challenge and reviewing the solutions of other users, I feel that my solution is super elementary and not very efficient. A reminder of how much I still need to learn and, more importantly, practice.
